# This is a very simple sample configuration file sufficient to start an  #
# xrootd file caching data server using the default port 1094 and its     #
# companion cmsd. Trying to use the xrootd will cause the client to       #
# simply wait there is no redirector and this configuration file is       #
# insufficient to start one. Consult the reference manuals on how to      #
# create a usable configuration file to completely describe a functional  #
# xrootd cluster.                                                         #
#                                                                         #
# On start-up the xrootd will complain about not connecting to the pipe   #
# named '/var/spool/xrootd/.olb/olbd.admin'. This will continue until the #
# cmsd starts. When the cmsd start is will say ' Waiting for primary      #
# server to login.' Once xrootd is started and connects to the cmsd, the  #
# cmsd will complain 'Unable to connect socket to localhost' because      #
# there is no redirector. However, this shows that xrootd and cmsd have   #
# been correctly installed.                                               #
#                                                                         #
# Note: You should always create a *single* configuration file and use it #
# when starting each daemon that you need to run in the cluster!          #
